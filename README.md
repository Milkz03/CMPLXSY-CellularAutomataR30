# CellularAutomataR30
Python implementation of Cellular Automata (Rule 30)

This is a simple Python code that implements the 8 different state rules of Rule 30 of
Elementary Cellular Automata. It places the starting state in the middle of the top row
in a 13x25 area and prints out the results. Below is a screenshot of the sample output.
